      <p>
        Welcome to the Say Their Name Project. Our aim to build an open-source
        platform to raise awareness of the injustice and often forgotten names
        of racial inequality at the hands of law enforcement. We strive to
        identify and amplify verified organizations to ensure donations are
        reaching those who can make the most impact with it.
